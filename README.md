# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer that allows you to see how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. It provides a visual representation of the sorting process, making it easier to understand and compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

## Getting Started

To run the sorting algorithm visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sorting-visualizer`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Adjust the array size and visualization speed using the sliders.
3. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
4. Observe the sorting process in real-time.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 to compare different sorting algorithms.
